# Laminar-Flow-over-a-Circular-Cylinder

The files Cylinder01.geo,...Cylinder03.geo contain the source code of the grids. To create the grids, open one of the .geo files e.g. the file Cylinder01.geo by opening the terminal and locating to the dirctory where you saved the file. Then type up in the terminal "gmshToFoam Cylinder01.geo" and create 3D mesh and then save the file as .msh. Then ./Allprepare in the terminal to adjust the boundary conditions. Finally, on the same terminal type mpirun -np 24 simpleFoam -parallel > log.simpleFoam. Note the number 24 corresponds to the number of cores I have, so you may need to change the number to number of cores you have! You can also plot the residual on the fly by opening a new terminal and locationg to the case file and typing gnuplot Residual.
